## Overview
This is a solution to the [Frontend Engineer (VueJS/Nuxt)](https://www.figma.com/file/eXk5QkQgBo89Srz5Gp4NVN/Frontend-Engineer-Task?node-id=1%3A12062) test application. It is a simple task to create a simple VueJS application to test the UI and reasoning skills of a frontend engineer.

### Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

### The challenge

Replicate this [dashboard UI design](https://www.figma.com/file/eXk5QkQgBo89Srz5Gp4NVN/Frontend-Engineer-Task?node-id=0%3A1) using NuxtJS. Push your code to a public Github repository, and host it on a free web hosting platform.

Ensure the design replications are pixel perfect, write clean and reusable code where necessary. We do not care too much about functionality, just the UI replication is sufficient.
